# Solana Token Trading Platform

A decentralized trading platform for Solana tokens using customizable bonding curves. This platform enables the creation and trading of tokens with automated market making functionality through bonding curves.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Token Trading Interface**
   - Handles buying and selling of tokens
   - Real-time price calculations based on bonding curve formula
   - Token-specific state management
   - Transaction handling and wallet integration

2. **Bonding Curve Implementation**
   - Custom pricing algorithm
   - Per-token SOL reserves tracking
   - Price impact calculations
   - Minimum reserve requirements
   - Automated market making functionality

3. **Token Management**
   - Token metadata storage
   - SOL reserves tracking per token
   - Supply management
   - Associated Token Account (ATA) handling

### Key Features

- **Independent Token Pricing**: Each token maintains its own bonding curve and SOL reserves
- **Real-time Price Updates**: Prices update automatically based on supply and reserves
- **Price Impact Protection**: Warnings for high-impact trades
- **Automated Market Making**: Liquidity provided through bonding curve mechanics
- **Token-Specific Reserves**: Each token tracks its own SOL reserves independently
- **Devnet Support**: Full testing environment on Solana Devnet

## Technical Implementation

### Bonding Curve Mechanics

First, the token creation:
tokenCreation.ts
}
And here's the trading functionality:
bondingCurve.ts
}
And finally, the transaction execution in your UI component:
TradingInterface.tsx
}
Key changes made:
Using PDAs instead of generated keypairs
Master keypair signs all transactions
PDAs own the token accounts and SOL
Proper authority delegation through PDAs
Simplified transaction signing flow
This structure ensures:
One master authority controlling all bonding curves
Deterministic addresses for all bonding curve accounts
Proper separation of funds between different tokens
Secure authority delegation through PDAs
