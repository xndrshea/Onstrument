# Solana Token Trading Platform

A decentralized trading platform for Solana tokens using customizable bonding curves. This platform enables the creation and trading of tokens with automated market making functionality through on-chain bonding curves.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **On-Chain Bonding Curve Program**
   - Rust program handling all trading logic
   - Atomic buy/sell operations
   - On-chain price calculations
   - Automated fee collection and buybacks
   - State management through PDAs
   - Slippage protection

2. **Token Trading Interface**
   - React frontend for user interactions
   - Real-time price updates
   - Wallet integration
   - Transaction monitoring
   - Trade history display

3. **Token Management**
   - Token metadata storage
   - Supply tracking
   - Associated Token Account (ATA) handling
   - Creator tools and analytics
   
Who Uses This:
1. Token Creators:
Project owners or developers who want to launch a token with an automated market maker
They need to provide initial parameters and pay for the transaction fees
End Users (indirectly):
Will interact with the created token through other instructions (buy/sell)
The bonding curve determines the price they pay for tokens
Protocol:
The smart contract itself manages the token supply and pricing
Acts as an automated market maker through the bonding curve mechanism
This is typically part of a larger DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocol where users can trade tokens in a decentralized way, with prices determined mathematically rather than through traditional order books.
The code uses Anchor framework (a popular Solana development framework) and follows Solana's programming patterns for PDAs (Program Derived Addresses) and CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) calls.

### Key Features

- **On-Chain Price Calculation**: All pricing logic handled securely on-chain
- **Atomic Transactions**: Single-instruction trades for maximum reliability
- **Automated Buybacks**: 100% of fees used for token buybacks, permanently
- **Independent Token Pricing**: Each token maintains its own bonding curve and SOL reserves
- **Real-time Price Updates**: Prices update automatically based on supply and reserves
- **Price Impact Protection**: Built-in slippage protection for trades
- **Token-Specific Reserves**: Each token tracks its own SOL reserves independently
- **Devnet Support**: Full testing environment on Solana Devnet

### Key Security Features

- PDAs for authority delegation
- On-chain price calculation
- Atomic transactions
- Built-in slippage protection
- Automated fee collection

## Roadmap

1. **Launch Phase**

## Fee Structure

- **Trading Fee**: 100% of all fees are permanently allocated to token buybacks
- **Implementation**: Automated on-chain buyback mechanism
- **Transparency**: All buybacks are publicly verifiable on-chain
- **Permanence**: Fee structure is immutable and cannot be changed
